# N&#x2082;O - Nitrous Oxide


This is the main source code reposity for the Nitro programming language. It
contains the current Nitro compiler N&#x2082;O, as well as tools and
documentation.

## Quick Start

Its not done yet. Why are you even reading this.

## Background

The Nitro programming language was originally designed and developed by Dr.
Allan Clark, while researching at the University of Edinburgh. The original
design of the Nitro programming language and its respective compilers can be
found in Dr. Clark's PhD [thesis].

None of this would have been possible without the original work of Dr. Allan
Clark and his advising team. For that work, we are thankful.
